## Update Log
**Version: 1.0**

Bot's finally hosted so I added a few things that would optimise it. Also preparing the bot to connect the bot to a spreadsheet so levels won't reset between bot updates. 

*Updates*

- [x] Invite command so you can easily add the bot to your server;
- [x] Bot replies get deleted after 5 seconds in some commands;
- [x] I had put the right invite in support command. Sorry for that...;
- [ ] Free cookies. Budget cuts... *shrug*
 
 **NOTE** Self hosting is allowed although support is not provided.
